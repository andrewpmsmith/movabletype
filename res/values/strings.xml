    <string name="basics_text">
        Players take turns making words from a 5x5 board of tiles. 
        Tap letters from anywhere on the board to assemble a word, then tap 
        \"SUMBIT\" to turn those tiles your color.

        - Words must have at least two letters\n- Words may only be played 
        once\n- Words may not be a prefix of a previously played word. For 
        example, if Player 1 plays the word "QUILTS", Player 2 cannot play 
        "QUILT" (but "QUILTED" and "QUIT" would both be fine). Prefixes are 
        literal, so QUART is a prefix of QUARTZ. And variations of words may be 
        played, e.g. SHORTED after SHORT.\n- No proper nouns (i.e. Capitalized 
        words), abbreviations, or acronyms.

        You can protect a tile from being stolen by surrounding it with other 
        tiles of the same color. Players may use defended tiles to make a word, 
        but they won\'t change color.\n Note that defended tiles aren\'t 
        permanent, they will become vulnerable if their neighbors change color.

        Your score is the number of tiles that are your color. The game ends 
        when every tile on the board has a color - or - when both players pass 
        their turn in a round. Then the tiles are tallied, and the player with 
        the highest score wins!
